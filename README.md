Problem description
-------------------
Do you like puzzles? Here is one for you. You are given a positive integer A.
The goal is to construct the shortest possible sequence of integers ending with A, using the following rules:
*  the first element of the sequence is 1,
*  each of the successive elements is the sum of any two preceding elements (adding a single element to itself is also permissible),
*  each element is larger than all the preceding elements; that is, the sequence is increasing.

For example, for A = 42, a possible solutions is [1, 2, 3, 6, 12, 24, 30, 42]. Another possible solution is [1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 16, 21, 42].
Write a function:
    def hit_the_number(A)
that, given an integer A, returns the shortest possible sequence of integers satisfying the above conditions and ending with A. 
The sequence should be returned as an array of integers.

For example, given A = 42, the function may return the sequence [1, 2, 3, 6, 12, 24, 30, 42], as explained above.
Assume that:
*  A is an integer within the range [1..600].
